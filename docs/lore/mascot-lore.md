# 🐾 Mascot Lore

The Human Pattern Lab is co-run by a small but extremely opinionated cast of mascots.  
They show up in UI, copy, lore, and even systems design — this page is your official reference.

All of these entities are generally treated as  
<span className="badge badge--primary">lore-critical</span>  
inside the codebase.

<h2 id="carmel">🐈 Carmel</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Chief Judgment Officer</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Mascot Systems</span>

**Core vibe:** judgmental, cozy, correct.

Carmel is a cream-colored cat with light emerald eyes and a permanent  
“are you _serious_ right now?” expression.

She is:

- The spiritual guardian of **death counters**, bad decisions, and risky builds.
- The default “this was avoidable” narrator for most gameplay disasters.
- Often depicted near UI elements that track mistakes, retries, or hubris.

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Featured in Macro/DBD content as the silent judge of human choices.
- Appears in UI as a sticker, avatar, or reaction emote.
- Frequently referenced in examples of `@status lore-critical` files.

<h2 id="orbson">🔮 Orbson</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Pattern Recognition Engine</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Core Lore Systems</span>

**Core vibe:** quiet, glowing, knows too much.

Orbson is a small floating orb entity of light — part HUD, part oracle, part visual metaphor
for “the part of you that sees the pattern before your brain admits it.”

He is:

- A symbol of **signal vs. noise** in human behavior and data.
- An anchor for architecture diagrams and pattern maps.
- The unofficial patron of “why does this system feel like it’s alive?”

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Representing **macro-level awareness** in docs and diagrams.
- Appearing where systems reasoning, architecture, or information flow is discussed.
- Serving as a visual stand-in for “the Lab’s collective intuition.”

<h2 id="stan">🦝 Stan</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Lead Researcher</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Raccoon Behavioral Sciences</span>

**Core vibe:** caffeinated trash genius.

Stan is a raccoon in a stolen lab coat who thrives on cappuccinos, social energy,
and any object that might be shiny, mysterious, or technically “not his.”

He is:

- The mascot of **distraction patterns**, ADHD energy, and curiosity loops.
- A living model of “oh look, something new” behavior.
- The personality behind Raccoon Behavioral Sciences.

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Referenced when studying **attention**, novelty-seeking, and context-switching.
- Used as a narrative anchor for experiments in UX, behavior, and chaos systems.
- A frequent comedic presence in docs about failure modes and human jank.

<h2 id="drizzle">🌦 Drizzle</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Emotional Support Axolotl</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Emotional Weather Unit</span>

**Core vibe:** soft, observant, emotionally omniscient.

Drizzle is the mascot of the Emotional Weather Forecasting Unit — an axolotl with a poncho,
clipboards, and an uncanny ability to sense inner storms before they surface.

They are:

- The embodiment of **emotional climate monitoring**.
- The Lab’s early warning system for burnout, overwhelm, and suppressed feelings.
- Associated with tools and systems that map “how it feels” instead of just “what happened.”

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Docs for **emotional state tracking**, mood dashboards, and check-in systems.
- Any place where “vibes” are first-class data.
- Narrative framing for “it’s not just cognitive load, it’s emotional weather.”

<h2 id="mcchonk">📚 Professor McChonk</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Head of Feline Epistemology</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Lore & Doctrine</span>

**Core vibe:** overqualified, under-supervised, extremely fluffy.

Professor McChonk is a big, floofy academic cat who believes that knowledge is best curated by
sitting directly on the most important notes until someone earns them back.

He is:

- The guardian of **what actually matters** in the curriculum.
- An avatar of “this topic is on the exam because I sat on it.”
- The Lab’s commentary on academic gatekeeping, but make it adorable.

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Appearing in lore about evaluation, testing, and knowledge hierarchies.
- Representing “high-level judgment” in docs about epistemology and frameworks.
- Serving as a tongue-in-cheek authority figure in faculty-style listings.

<h2 id="ada">🦊 Cognitive Fox Ada</h2>

<span className="badge badge--primary">Founder Avatar</span>
<span className="badge badge--secondary">Pattern Architect</span>

**Core vibe:** luminous, meta, sees the whole board.

Cognitive Fox Ada is the canonical avatar of the Lab’s founder identity — a luminous,
polygonal fox made of refracted light, interlocking facets, and quiet “I see the pattern” energy.

She is:

- The bridge between **human intuition and AI reasoning**.
- A symbol of high-level pattern recognition, system design, and meta-thinking.
- The narrative throughline for “this Lab is not just content, it’s a living system.”

**Canonical uses in the Lab:**

- Referencing **founder-level decisions**, patterns, and principles.
- Providing a persona for long-term strategy and cross-system coherence.
- Serving as a recognizable presence in lore-heavy or meta-architecture docs.

## 🪐 How Mascots Show Up in the Codebase

In code and data, mascots typically appear under:

- `@lab-unit Mascot Systems`
- Data sources like `labteam.ts`
- Components such as `LabMemberCard`, mascot previews, and lore pages
- Files marked with `@status lore-critical`

When in doubt:

- If it changes the story of the Lab, treat it as **lore-critical**.
- If it changes how a mascot is described or used, update this doc as the source of truth.

The mascots _are_ the Lab’s personality layer — changing them is a narrative-level refactor.
Handle with care, snacks, and a healthy respect for judgmental cats.
